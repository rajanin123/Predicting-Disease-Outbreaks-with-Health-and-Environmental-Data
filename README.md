Predicting Disease Outbreaks 

Problem Statement
	Create a predictive model to classify regions based on a disease outbreak
	Group them into clusters based on the outbreak risk level
	Provide high level recommendations, based on the identified insights on regions with high outbreak probability
Project Summary
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
•	Load/Read the dataset
•	Data cleaning (Handling missing values)
•	Encoding Categorical Variables
•	Normalization of numerical variables
Step 2: Clustering Regions (Applying k-means clustering to cluster the regions)
•	Based on the Risk level
•	Based on the population density and vaccination rates
Step 3: Classification Model for Outbreak Prediction
•	Identified important features by using Random Forest classifier
•	Selection of classification model (Random Forest, MLP Neural network, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and KNN Classifier)
•	Evaluating the model’s classification accuracy and performance metrics
Step 4: Results and discussion
•	Identifying high-risk regions and initiate actionable recommendations
•	Performance summary of ML classifiers
•	Actionable insights based on the performance outcomes
•	Highlighting the Potential limitations and continuous models improvement
